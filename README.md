# Non-Linear-Programming
### Project Summary:
Problem Statement: Addressing variable selection for regression using mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) compared to the LASSO approach.

### Objective: Evaluate whether MIQP for variable selection in regression outperforms LASSO's shrinkage technique.

### Methodology:
- MIQP Approach:
Introduction of binary variables (Zj) to enforce ùõΩùëó values and control variable inclusion.
Flexibility in precise variable selection for impactful models.
Inclusion of an intercept term (ùõΩ0) and hyperparameter tuning (k) through cross-validation.
- LASSO Approach:
Sparse variable selection by shrinking ùõΩ coefficients.
Overfitting prevention and intercept term inclusion without penalty.


### Results and Comparison:
- Performance Metrics:
MIQP showed superior performance in certain error metrics, demonstrating lower SSE and MSE, but similar R-squared values to LASSO.
LASSO exhibited a comparative ability to explain data variability.

- Findings and Considerations:

1. MIQP Advantages:

Enhanced accuracy in test sets, although computationally demanding.
Robustness in predicting outcomes with the optimal hyperparameter k.

2. LASSO Advantages:

Efficiency in computational resources and quick model updates.
Ease of implementation, especially for individuals with limited coding experience.


### Comparison Analysis:
Number of Non-Zero Coefficients:

LASSO identified 17 significant features compared to MIQP's 10, influencing model interpretability and performance.


### Conclusion and Recommendations:
Method Selection Criteria:
Suggested considerations for method selection based on computational resources, model performance, and ease of implementation.
Future Directions:
Highlighted the need for a balanced discussion and thoughtful consideration of specific business objectives in method selection.
